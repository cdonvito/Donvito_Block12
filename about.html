        <p class="Hobby_Text" id="Salt_Text">
          Over the past few years I have been really enjoying setting up and
          maintaining salt water reef aquariums. Currently, I only have one
          salt-water tank, but am planning out the design of another, much
          larger, tank. My current tank is ~15 gallons and has a variety of
          life! As far as animals go, I currently have 2 clown fish, a six-line
          wrasse, 2 hermit crabs, an emerald crab, 2 turbo snails, and a
          plethera of other smaller snails. I also have a variety of corals
          throughout the tank and am planning on getting an anenome soon for the
          clownfish to host.

          I also really enjoy camping with my wife and dog. We have a renovated
          van that we built togehter and have traveled all over the country in.
          We even drove the van out to California to get married and camped
          along the way! Being outdoors is one of my favorite things to do,
          especially when there are scenic views!

        <p class="Hobby_Text" id="Scuba_Text">
          I went on my first discover scuba dive about 8 years ago and fell in
          love with the hobby! I almost immediately got certified and have been
          diving all over the world since. Recently my wife and I went on our
          honeymoon to Bali and were able to go diving all over the country. We
          saw all kinds of marine life and amazing coral reefs. One of the most
          amazing creatures we saw while there were a plethera of octopi. Their
          ability to change colors so rapidly is one of the more impressive
          things I have seen.
