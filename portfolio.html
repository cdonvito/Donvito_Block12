        <h3>Automated Submittal Generator</h3>

        <p class="Portfolio_Text">
          During my time working as a project engineer at FLASH, I built a
          submittal generator using Google Apps Script. The primary objective of
          this code was to automate submittal packets containing all of the
          product information relative to that specific project. Using a Google
          Form, the user enters in the relevant project specific information.
          Upon submitting the form, the code pulls togther all of the relevant
          product data sheets based on the user's selections. It compiles all of
          these sheets into a folder and then makes a merged PDF of all of the
          documentation and saves it to a subsequent folder. It also creates a
          cover page, scope of work page that is tailored to the project, a
          table on contents, and numbers all of the pages of the packet. When
          the code is finished running it sends the user an email letting them
          know that the generation was successful and where they can find the
          saved files.

        <h3>Project Folder Automation</h3>

        <p class="Portfolio_Text">
          Another tool I created while working at FLASH was a way to automate
          project folder creation. FLASH utilizes a CRM (customer relationship
          management) tool called Salesforce. I built a way to automatically
          create a project folder once a new opportunity in Salesforce is
          created. I also created a local database with all of these
          opportunities to check for folders existing in the repository that
          should not belong.

        <h3>Jira Design Ticketing</h3>

        <p class="Portfolio_Text">
          Another tool I built while at FLASH was a design ticketing sytem
          utilized by our Field Design Engineers. This ticketing sytem allowed
          employees to request an AutoCAD drawing of their specfic project. This
          allowed for a streamline way to track drawing progress.
