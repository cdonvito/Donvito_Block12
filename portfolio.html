      <h3>Automated Submittal Generator</h3>

      <p id="First_Project">
        During my time working as a project engineer at FLASH, I built a
        submittal generator using Google Apps Script. The primary objective of
        this code was to automate submittal packets containing all of the
        product information relative to that specific project. Using a Google
        Form, the user enters in the relevant project specific information. Upon
        submitting the form, the code pulls togther all of the relevant product
        data sheets based on the user's selections. It compiles all of these
        sheets into a folder and then makes a merged PDF of all of the
        documentation and saves it to a subsequent folder. It also creates a
        cover page, scope of work page that is tailored to the project, a table
        on contents, and numbers all of the pages of the packet. When the code
        is finished running it sends the user an email letting them know that
        the generation was successful and where they can find the saved files.

      <h3>Project Folder Automation</h3>

      <p id="Second_Project">
        Another tool I created while working at FLASH was a way to automate
        project folder creation. FLASH utilizes a CRM (customer relationship
        management) tool called Salesforce. I built a way to automatically
        create a project folder once a new opportunity in Salesforce is created.
        I also created a local database with all of these opportunities to check
        for folders existing in the repository that should not belong.
      </p>

      <h3>Jira Design Ticketing</h3>

      <p id="Third_Project">
        Another tool I built while at FLASH was a design ticketing sytem
        utilized by our Field Design Engineers. This ticketing sytem allowed
        employees to request an AutoCAD drawing of their specfic project. This
        allowed for a streamline way to track drawing progress.
